If you have Berkely 4.2  or System 5 or SUN O/S Version 4
you should have little trouble with installating
this on a 32 bit machine (see READ_ME in the evaluator directory). 

If you are not running on UNIX or a UNIX-like system you will have
to do a little work to get your Lucid interpreter working. In particular
the directories p1 to p5 each produce a pass or filter each sucessive
piping (in the UNIX sense) its input to the next. The code within
each pass is reasonably straight forward. If you have a yacc of Your
own you may want to
remove the y.tab.c and y.tab.h directories and use your
own yacc to generate these. If you do not have yacc you can use the
y.tab.c and y.tab.h provided.

There are 9 subdirectories:
        p1              :Source for filter1 (lucid -> lucid parse tree(pt))
                                          i.e. checks for syntax errors.
        p2              :Source for filter2 (lucid pt -> lucid pt)
                                          checks for nameclashes
        p3              :Source for filter3 (lucid pt -> lucid pt)
                                          expands upon and whenever.
        p4              :Source for filter4(lucid pt->structured lucid pt)
        p5              :Source for filter5 (s-lucid pt -> lucid i-code)
	evaluator	:Source for the lucid evaluator
        manual          :lucid programming manual/UNIX manual entry
        progs           :Example lucid programs
        shell_scripts   :Scripts for compiling and/or running
                         lucid programs


Installing lucid
================

 In directory p1 change the third line of file main.c to some
 appropriate directory. It is currently

 STRING incdir = "/ud/cscfac/faustini/lu/lib";

 If you are running Berkley UNIX 4.2bsd or have the
 make facility then all you then
 do is to type

     make all "DESTDIR=/the/directory/where/you/want/your/binary/progs"

the makefile in this directory will do the rest.

    E.g. at ASU we would enter

         make all "DESTDIR=/usr/local/bin"
