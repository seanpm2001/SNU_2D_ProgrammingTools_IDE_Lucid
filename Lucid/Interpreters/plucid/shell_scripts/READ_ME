This directory contains two shell scripts. You will have to
decide on where you want to put these in your system. This may
involve small changes to these shell_scripts and to the
makefile in ../lu/p1 to ../lu/p6. Note lucomp and luval are the
names used in the UNIX manual entry. (see ../lu/doc/lucid.1 )

   I)  lucid <filename>   used to compile and run lucid
       programmes.

  II)  lucomp (filename> used to compile lucid programmes.


 Note luval is not a shell script it is simple the a.out file
      associated with pass6. (see makefile in ../lu/p6 )
